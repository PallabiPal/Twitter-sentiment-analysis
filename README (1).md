# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets using Python. The goal is to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.

## Features
- Data Collection: Gather tweets using the Twitter API based on specific hashtags, keywords, or user accounts.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess tweet text to remove noise, including stopwords, URLs, mentions, and hashtags.
- Sentiment Classification: Classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using machine learning models.
- Visualization: Generate visualizations to display sentiment distribution and trends over time.
- Customizable Filters: Apply filters to analyze sentiment for specific topics, keywords, or time periods.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language for the project.
- Tweepy: A Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
- NLTK/Spacy: Libraries for natural language processing and text analysis.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for building and evaluating sentiment classification models.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization and generating plots.
- Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
